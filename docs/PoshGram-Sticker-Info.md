# Send stickers using PoshGram

*How can I use PoshGram to get my bot to send stickers?*

## 4 ways to send stickers

### 1 - Send-TelegramLocalSticker

- This sends a locally sourced sticker (.WEBP/.TGS)
- ```Send-TelegramLocalSticker -BotToken $botToken -ChatID $chat -StickerPath $sticker```

### 2 - **Send-TelegramURLSticker**

- This sends a sticker (.WEBP/.TGS) located at a specified URL
- ```Send-TelegramURLSticker -BotToken $token -ChatID $channel -StickerURL $StickerURL```

### 3 - **Send-TelegramSticker** by file_id

- You already know the file_id of the sticker you want to send
- ```Send-TelegramSticker -BotToken $botToken -ChatID $chat -FileID $sticker```
    - If you *do not know* the file_id, you can leverage ***Get-TelegramStickerPackInfo*** to determine that information:
        - ```Get-TelegramStickerPackInfo -BotToken $botToken -StickerSetName STPicard```

### 4 - **Send-TelegramSticker** by Sticker pack name + emoji shortcode

Via this method you can provide the name of the sticker pack.

- *Ex. STPicard*
- *Ex. CookieMonster*

You also provide the emoji shortcode of the emoji you are trying to convey.

- *Ex. ':<zero-width space>slightly_smiling_face:'*
- *Ex. ':<zero-width space>grinning:'*

**Notes around this method:**

- Sticker packs are controlled by their *author*
    - Not every sticker has a corresponding emoji
    - Some sticker authors have the same emoji linked to multiple stickers
- This method will make a best attempt to look up the sticker pack you specify and send a sticker that matches the corresponding emoji shortcode.

If you don't want to have a *best attempt* scenario, use ***Get-TelegramStickerPackInfo*** to determine the exact file_id's from the sticker pack you'd like to send.
