## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!--- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc. -->

If you discover a vulnerability in PoshGram, please follow the _following process_:

1. Open a generic bug issue advising you have discovered a vulnerability.
   - Avoid sharing specifics or details of the vulnerability in an open GitHub issue.
2. A repo owner will reach out to you to establish a private form of communication.
3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
